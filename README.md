# Sleek-GUI-with-Tkinter
Multipage application designed to be scalable and easy to use. It uses multiple frames to organize the code and make it more readable. To achieve scalability, we'll create our own custom widgets. These custom widgets are designed to be reusable and help to reduce the amount of code needed for the application. The use of custom widgets also makes the application more flexible, allowing it to be easily adapted to different use cases.

There are three folders in this repo
1. py_files : It contains py files for the GUI if you want to open in IDE.
2. ipynb_files: It contains ipynb files for the same code so that you can open in jupyter notebook
3. TrialGUI: it contains a sample GUI which explains the concept of multipage tkinter GUI

I've written a article that explains TrialGUI
